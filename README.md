# PPM tty Renderer

![preview](./Preview.jpeg)

This is a renderer for PPM-P3 files, used to render images in a format easily readable by a human. This renderer displays pixels on the screen, using a memory-mapped framebuffer. I created this microproject just for practice. It's cool, I hope it's useful for learning.

Oh, I forgot an important detail: it only works for Linux, of course. Later I will do a completely low-level test without standard libraries, for x86.
